The natives of the\nBritish Colony complained that many of their young men were enticed away through\nthe medium of fair and glowing promises, but that few if any ever returned to\ntheir families.\n\nThe Englishmen in Africa went even further, saying that these poor blacks were\nheld in virtual slavery, since after their terms of enlistment expired their\nignorance was imposed upon by their white officers, and they were told that they\nhad yet several years to serve.\n\nAnd so the Colonial Office appointed John Clayton to a new post in British West\nAfrica, but his confidential instructions centered on a thorough investigation\nof the unfair treatment of black British subjects by the officers of a friendly\nEuropean power. Why he was sent, is, however, of little moment to this story,\nfor he never made an investigation, nor, in fact, did he ever reach his\ndestination.\n\nClayton was the type of Englishman that one likes best to associate with the\nnoblest monuments of historic achievement upon a thousand victorious\nbattlefields--a strong, virile man --mentally, morally, and physically.\n\nIn stature he was above the average height; his eyes were gray, his features\nregular and strong; his carriage that of perfect, robust health influenced by\nhis years of army training.\n\nPolitical ambition had caused him to seek transference from the army to the\nColonial Office and so we find him, still young, entrusted with a delicate and\nimportant commission in the service of the Queen.\n\nWhen he received this appointment he was both elated and appalled. The\npreferment seemed to him in the nature of a well-merited reward for painstaking\nand intelligent service, and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance\nand responsibility; but, on the other hand, he had been married to the Hon.\nAlice Rutherford for scarce a three months, and it was the thought of taking\nthis fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical Africa that\nappalled him.\n\nFor her sake he would have refused the appointment, but she would not have it\nso. Instead she insisted that he accept, and, indeed, take her with him.\n\nThere were mothers and brothers and sisters, and aunts and cousins to express\nvarious opinions on the subject, but as to what they severally advised history\nis silent.\n\nWe know only that on a bright May morning in 1888, John, Lord Greystoke, and\nLady Alice sailed from Dover on their way to Africa.\n\nA month later they arrived at Freetown where they chartered a small sailing\nvessel, the Fuwalda, which was to bear them to their final destination.\n\nAnd here John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice, his wife, vanished from the eyes\nand from the knowledge of men.\n\nTwo months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port of Freetown a\nhalf dozen British war vessels were scouring the south Atlantic for trace of\nthem or their little vessel, and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was\nfound upon the shores of St. Helena which convinced the world that the Fuwalda\nhad gone down with all on board, and hence the search was stopped ere it had\nscarce begun; though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years.\n\nThe Fuwalda, a barkentine of about one hundred tons, was a vessel of the type\noften seen in coastwise trade in the far southern Atlantic, their crews composed\nof the offscourings of the sea--unhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race\nand every nation.\n\nThe Fuwalda was no exception to the rule. Her officers were swarthy bullies,\nhating and hated by their crew. The captain, while a competent seaman, was a\nbrute in his treatment of his men. He knew, or at least he used, but two\narguments in his dealings with them--a belaying pin and a revolver--nor is it\nlikely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else.\n\nSo it was that from the second day out from Freetown John Clayton and his young\nwife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the Fuwalda such as they had believed\nwere never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea.\n\nIt was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what\nwas destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then\nunborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man.\n\nTwo sailors were washing down the decks of the Fuwalda, the first mate was on\nduty, and the captain had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice.\n\nThe men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from\nthe sailors. Closer and closer they came, until one of them was directly behind\nthe captain. In another moment he would have passed by and this strange\nnarrative would never have been recorded.\n\nBut just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and Lady Greystoke, and,\nas he did so, tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck,\noverturning the water- pail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents.\n\nFor an instant the scene was ludicrous; but only for an instant. With a volley\nof awful oaths, his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage,\nthe captain regained his feet, and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the\ndeck.\n\nThe man was small and rather old, so that the brutality of the act was thus\naccentuated. The other seaman, however, was neither old nor small--a huge bear\nof a man, with fierce black mustachios, and a great bull neck set between\nmassive shoulders.\n\nAs he saw his mate go down he crouched, and, with a low snarl, sprang upon the\ncaptain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow.\n\nFrom scarlet the officer's face went white, for this was mutiny; and mutiny he\nhad met and subdued before in his brutal career. Without waiting to rise he\nwhipped a revolver from his pocket, firing point blank at the great mountain of\nmuscle towering before him; but, quick as he was, John Clayton was almost as\nquick, so that the bullet which was intended for the sailor's heart lodged in\nthe sailor's leg instead, for Lord Greystoke had struck down the captain's arm\nas he had seen the weapon flash in the sun.\n\nWords passed between Clayton and the captain, the former making it plain that he\nwas disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew, nor would he\ncountenance anything further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained\npassengers.\n\nThe captain was on the point of making an angry reply, but, thinking better of\nit, turned on his heel and black and scowling, strode aft.\n\nHe did not care to antagonize an English official, for the Queen's mighty arm\nwielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate, and which he\nfeared--England's far-reaching navy.\n\nThe two sailors picked themselves up, the older man assisting his wounded\ncomrade to rise. The big fellow, who was known among his mates as Black Michael,\ntried his leg gingerly, and, finding that it bore his weight, turned to Clayton\nwith a word of gruff thanks.\n\nThough the fellow's tone was surly, his words were evidently well meant. Ere he\nhad scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward\nthe forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further\nconversation.\n\nThey did not see him again for several days, nor did the captain accord them\nmore than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them.\n\nThey took their meals in his cabin, as they had before the unfortunate\noccurrence; but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted\nhim to eat at the same time.\n\nThe other officers were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little above the\nvillainous crew they bullied, and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse\nwith the polished English noble and his lady, so that the Claytons were left\nvery much to themselves.\n\nThis in itself accorded perfectly with their desires, but it also rather\nisolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep\nin touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody\ntragedy.",feature_image:o,featured:c,visibility:b,created_at:p,updated_at:q,published_at:r,custom_excerpt:a,codeinjection_head:a,codeinjection_foot:a,custom_template:a,canonical_url:a,send_email_when_published:c,tags:[{id:e,name:f,slug:g,description:a,feature_image:a,visibility:b,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,og_image:a,og_title:a,og_description:a,twitter_image:a,twitter_title:a,twitter_description:a,codeinjection_head:a,codeinjection_foot:a,canonical_url:a,accent_color:a,url:h}],authors:[{id:s,name:t,slug:u,profile_image:v,cover_image:w,bio:x,website:a,location:y,facebook:a,twitter:a,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,url:z}],primary_author:{id:s,name:t,slug:u,profile_image:v,cover_image:w,bio:x,website:a,location:y,facebook:a,twitter:a,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,url:z},primary_tag:{id:e,name:f,slug:g,description:a,feature_image:a,visibility:b,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,og_image:a,og_title:a,og_description:a,twitter_image:a,twitter_title:a,twitter_description:a,codeinjection_head:a,codeinjection_foot:a,canonical_url:a,accent_color:a,url:h},url:A,excerpt:B,reading_time:C,access:d,og_image:a,og_title:a,og_description:a,twitter_image:a,twitter_title:a,twitter_description:a,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,email_subject:a,related_posts:[{id:"5979a77cdf093500228e95e8",uuid:"7a125d48-7864-40c2-8324-81bf1bc95352",title:"The Businessman & The Fisherman",slug:"the-businessman-the-fisherman",html:"\u003C!--kg-card-begin: markdown--\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on doctor’s orders.

Most of the &quot;brethren&quot; think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEducation must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one's self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically.

The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America.

The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts.

The natives of the British Colony complained that many of their young men were enticed away through the medium of fair and glowing promises, but that few if any ever returned to their families.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Englishmen in Africa went even further, saying that these poor blacks were held in virtual slavery, since after their terms of enlistment expired their ignorance was imposed upon by their white officers, and they were told that they had yet several years to serve.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so the Colonial Office appointed John Clayton to a new post in British West Africa, but his confidential instructions centered on a thorough investigation of the unfair treatment of black British subjects by the officers of a friendly European power. Why he was sent, is, however, of little moment to this story, for he never made an investigation, nor, in fact, did he ever reach his destination.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EClayton was the type of Englishman that one likes best to associate with the noblest monuments of historic achievement upon a thousand victorious battlefields--a strong, virile man --mentally, morally, and physically.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn stature he was above the average height; his eyes were gray, his features regular and strong; his carriage that of perfect, robust health influenced by his years of army training.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPolitical ambition had caused him to seek transference from the army to the Colonial Office and so we find him, still young, entrusted with a delicate and important commission in the service of the Queen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen he received this appointment he was both elated and appalled. The preferment seemed to him in the nature of a well-merited reward for painstaking and intelligent service, and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance and responsibility; but, on the other hand, he had been married to the Hon. Alice Rutherford for scarce a three months, and it was the thought of taking this fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical Africa that appalled him.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor her sake he would have refused the appointment, but she would not have it so. Instead she insisted that he accept, and, indeed, take her with him.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere were mothers and brothers and sisters, and aunts and cousins to express various opinions on the subject, but as to what they severally advised history is silent.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe know only that on a bright May morning in 1888, John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice sailed from Dover on their way to Africa.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA month later they arrived at Freetown where they chartered a small sailing vessel, the Fuwalda, which was to bear them to their final destination.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd here John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice, his wife, vanished from the eyes and from the knowledge of men.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port of Freetown a half dozen British war vessels were scouring the south Atlantic for trace of them or their little vessel, and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was found upon the shores of St. Helena which convinced the world that the Fuwalda had gone down with all on board, and hence the search was stopped ere it had scarce begun; though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Fuwalda, a barkentine of about one hundred tons, was a vessel of the type often seen in coastwise trade in the far southern Atlantic, their crews composed of the offscourings of the sea--unhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race and every nation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Fuwalda was no exception to the rule. Her officers were swarthy bullies, hating and hated by their crew. The captain, while a competent seaman, was a brute in his treatment of his men. He knew, or at least he used, but two arguments in his dealings with them--a belaying pin and a revolver--nor is it likely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it was that from the second day out from Freetown John Clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the Fuwalda such as they had believed were never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what was destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then unborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo sailors were washing down the decks of the Fuwalda, the first mate was on duty, and the captain had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from the sailors. Closer and closer they came, until one of them was directly behind the captain. In another moment he would have passed by and this strange narrative would never have been recorded.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and Lady Greystoke, and, as he did so, tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck, overturning the water- pail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor an instant the scene was ludicrous; but only for an instant. With a volley of awful oaths, his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage, the captain regained his feet, and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe man was small and rather old, so that the brutality of the act was thus accentuated. The other seaman, however, was neither old nor small--a huge bear of a man, with fierce black mustachios, and a great bull neck set between massive shoulders.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs he saw his mate go down he crouched, and, with a low snarl, sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom scarlet the officer's face went white, for this was mutiny; and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal career. Without waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from his pocket, firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle towering before him; but, quick as he was, John Clayton was almost as quick, so that the bullet which was intended for the sailor's heart lodged in the sailor's leg instead, for Lord Greystoke had struck down the captain's arm as he had seen the weapon flash in the sun.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWords passed between Clayton and the captain, the former making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew, nor would he countenance anything further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained passengers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe captain was on the point of making an angry reply, but, thinking better of it, turned on his heel and black and scowling, strode aft.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe did not care to antagonize an English official, for the Queen's mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate, and which he feared--England's far-reaching navy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe two sailors picked themselves up, the older man assisting his wounded comrade to rise. The big fellow, who was known among his mates as Black Michael, tried his leg gingerly, and, finding that it bore his weight, turned to Clayton with a word of gruff thanks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThough the fellow's tone was surly, his words were evidently well meant. Ere he had scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey did not see him again for several days, nor did the captain accord them more than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey took their meals in his cabin, as they had before the unfortunate occurrence; but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted him to eat at the same time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other officers were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little above the villainous crew they bullied, and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished English noble and his lady, so that the Claytons were left very much to themselves.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis in itself accorded perfectly with their desires, but it also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C!--kg-card-end: markdown--\u003E","4","https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fcontent\u002Fimages\u002F2015\u002F04\u002Fdemo6.jpg","2014-09-27T10:54:34.000+00:00","2018-08-20T15:11:55.000+00:00","1912-07-24T08:00:00.000+00:00","5979a779df093500228e958f","Edgar Rice Burroughs","edgar","https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fcontent\u002Fimages\u002F2018\u002F10\u002Fedgar.jpg","https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fcontent\u002Fimages\u002F2018\u002F08\u002FScreenshot-2018-08-23-14.08.38.png","I'm an American novelist, best known for my work writing about a brave jungle hero called Tarzan and his muse, Jane.","Chicago, Illinois","https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fauthor\u002Fedgar\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fout-to-sea\u002F","I had this story from one who had no business to tell it to me, or to any other.\nI may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the\nbeginning of it, and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed\nfor the balance of the strange tale.\n\nWhen my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much, and that I was\nprone to doubtfulness, his foolish pride assumed the task the old vintage had\ncommenced, and so he unearthed written evidence in the form of m",6,2,"5979a77cdf093500228e95eb","b0f08928-f6a0-4ba7-a971-851ea326ed6c","Looking-Glass house","looking-glass-house","\u003C!--kg-card-begin: markdown--\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it:— it was the black kitten’s fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it couldn’t have had any hand in the mischief.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way Dinah washed her children’s faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purr — no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Oh, you wicked little thing!’ cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. ‘Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You ought, Dinah, you know you ought!’ she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage — and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn’t get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?’ Alice began. ‘You’d have guessed if you’d been up in the window with me — only Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn’t. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire — and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we’ll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.’ Here Alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten’s neck, just to see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,’ Alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again, ‘when I saw all the mischief you had been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow! And you’d have deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What have you got to say for yourself? Now don’t interrupt me!’ she went on, holding up one finger. ‘I’m going to tell you all your faults. Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning. Now you can’t deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What’s that you say?’ (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) ‘Her paw went into your eye? Well, that’s your fault, for keeping your eyes open — if you’d shut them tight up, it wouldn’t have happened. Now don’t make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were thirsty, were you?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you know she wasn’t thirsty too? Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn’t looking!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘That’s three faults, Kitty, and you’ve not been punished for any of them yet. You know I’m saving up all your punishments for Wednesday week — Suppose they had saved up all my punishments!’ she went on, talking more to herself than the kitten. ‘What would they do at the end of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came. Or — let me see — suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn’t mind that much! I’d far rather go without them than eat them!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, “Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.” And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress themselves all in green, and dance about — whenever the wind blows — oh, that’s very pretty!’ cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands. ‘And I do so wish it was true! I’m sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don’t smile, my dear, I’m asking it seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when I said “Check!” you purred! Well, it was a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn’t been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces. Kitty, dear, let’s pretend —’ And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase ‘Let’s pretend.’ She had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before — all because Alice had begun with ‘Let’s pretend we’re kings and queens;’ and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn’t, because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last to say, ‘Well, you can be one of them then, and I’ll be all the rest.’ And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, ‘Nurse! Do let’s pretend that I’m a hungry hyaena, and you’re a bone.’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut this is taking us away from Alice’s speech to the kitten. ‘Let’s pretend that you’re the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you sat up and folded your arms, you’d look exactly like her. Now do try, there’s a dear!’ And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing didn’t succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn’t fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was —‘and if you’re not good directly,’ she added, ‘I’ll put you through into Looking-glass House. How would you like that?’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Now, if you’ll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I’ll tell you all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there’s the room you can see through the glass — that’s just the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a chair — all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could see that bit! I want so much to know whether they’ve a fire in the winter: you never can tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too — but that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because I’ve held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the other room.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if they’d give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn’t good to drink — But oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a little peep of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open: and it’s very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond. Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-glass House! I’m sure it’s got, oh! such beautiful things in it!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s pretend there’s a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty. Let’s pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. Why, it’s turning into a sort of mist now, I declare! It’ll be easy enough to get through —’ She was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly the glass was beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. ‘So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room,’ thought Alice: ‘warmer, in fact, because there’ll be no one here to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun it’ll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and can’t get at me!’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘They don’t keep this room so tidy as the other,’ Alice thought to herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little ‘Oh!’ of surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking about, two and two!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,’ Alice said (in a whisper, for fear of frightening them), ‘and there are the White King and the White Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel — and here are two castles walking arm in arm — I don’t think they can hear me,’ she went on, as she put her head closer down, ‘and I’m nearly sure they can’t see me. I feel somehow as if I were invisible —’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next.\u003Cbr\u003E\n‘It is the voice of my child!’ the White Queen cried out as she rushed past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders. ‘My precious Lily! My imperial kitten!’ and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Imperial fiddlestick!’ said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a little annoyed with the Queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes, ‘Mind the volcano!’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘What volcano?’ said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Blew — me — up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath. ‘Mind you come up — the regular way — don’t get blown up!’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at last she said, ‘Why, you’ll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. I’d far better help you, hadn’t I?’ But the King took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn’t take his breath away: but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Oh! please don’t make such faces, my dear!’ she cried out, quite forgetting that the King couldn’t hear her. ‘You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you! And don’t keep your mouth so wide open! All the ashes will get into it — there, now I think you’re tidy enough!’ she added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the Queen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisper — so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe King was saying, ‘I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers!’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo which the Queen replied, ‘You haven’t got any whiskers.’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘The horror of that moment,’ the King went on, ‘I shall never, never forget!’\u003Cbr\u003E\n‘You will, though,’ the Queen said, ‘if you don’t make a memorandum of it.’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him, and at last he panted out, ‘My dear! I really must get a thinner pencil. I can’t manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I don’t intend —’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘What manner of things?’ said the Queen, looking over the book (in which Alice had put ‘the White Knight is sliding down the poker. He balances very badly’) ‘That’s not a memorandum of your feelings!’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C!--kg-card-end: markdown--\u003E","8","https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fcontent\u002Fimages\u002F2015\u002F04\u002Fdemo5.jpg","2014-09-27T16:23:18.000+00:00","2019-02-13T15:27:08.000+00:00","1871-03-18T10:00:00.000+00:00","https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Flooking-glass-house\u002F","One thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it:— it\nwas the black kitten’s fault entirely.

I may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning of it, and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed for the balance of the strange tale.</p> <p>When my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much, and that I was prone to doubtfulness, his foolish pride assumed the task the old vintage had commenced, and so he unearthed written evidence in the form of musty manuscript, and dry official records of the British Colonial Office to support many of the salient features of his remarkable narrative.</p> <p>I do not say the story is true, for I did not witness the happenings which it portrays, but the fact that in the telling of it to you I have taken fictitious names for the principal characters quite sufficiently evidences the sincerity of my own belief that it MAY be true.</p> <p>The yellow, mildewed pages of the diary of a man long dead, and the records of the Colonial Office dovetail perfectly with the narrative of my convivial host, and so I give you the story as I painstakingly pieced it out from these several various agencies.</p> <p>If you do not find it credible you will at least be as one with me in acknowledging that it is unique, remarkable, and interesting.</p> <p>From the records of the Colonial Office and from the dead man's diary we learn that a certain young English nobleman, whom we shall call John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, was commissioned to make a peculiarly delicate investigation of conditions in a British West Coast African Colony from whose simple native inhabitants another European power was known to be recruiting soldiers for its native army, which it used solely for the forcible collection of rubber and ivory from the savage tribes along the Congo and the Aruwimi. The natives of the British Colony complained that many of their young men were enticed away through the medium of fair and glowing promises, but that few if any ever returned to their families.</p> <p>The Englishmen in Africa went even further, saying that these poor blacks were held in virtual slavery, since after their terms of enlistment expired their ignorance was imposed upon by their white officers, and they were told that they had yet several years to serve.</p> <p>And so the Colonial Office appointed John Clayton to a new post in British West Africa, but his confidential instructions centered on a thorough investigation of the unfair treatment of black British subjects by the officers of a friendly European power. Why he was sent, is, however, of little moment to this story, for he never made an investigation, nor, in fact, did he ever reach his destination.</p> <p>Clayton was the type of Englishman that one likes best to associate with the noblest monuments of historic achievement upon a thousand victorious battlefields--a strong, virile man --mentally, morally, and physically.</p> <p>In stature he was above the average height; his eyes were gray, his features regular and strong; his carriage that of perfect, robust health influenced by his years of army training.</p> <p>Political ambition had caused him to seek transference from the army to the Colonial Office and so we find him, still young, entrusted with a delicate and important commission in the service of the Queen.</p> <p>When he received this appointment he was both elated and appalled. The preferment seemed to him in the nature of a well-merited reward for painstaking and intelligent service, and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance and responsibility; but, on the other hand, he had been married to the Hon. Alice Rutherford for scarce a three months, and it was the thought of taking this fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical Africa that appalled him.</p> <p>For her sake he would have refused the appointment, but she would not have it so. Instead she insisted that he accept, and, indeed, take her with him.</p> <p>There were mothers and brothers and sisters, and aunts and cousins to express various opinions on the subject, but as to what they severally advised history is silent.</p> <p>We know only that on a bright May morning in 1888, John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice sailed from Dover on their way to Africa.</p> <p>A month later they arrived at Freetown where they chartered a small sailing vessel, the Fuwalda, which was to bear them to their final destination.</p> <p>And here John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice, his wife, vanished from the eyes and from the knowledge of men.</p> <p>Two months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port of Freetown a half dozen British war vessels were scouring the south Atlantic for trace of them or their little vessel, and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was found upon the shores of St. Helena which convinced the world that the Fuwalda had gone down with all on board, and hence the search was stopped ere it had scarce begun; though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years.</p> <p>The Fuwalda, a barkentine of about one hundred tons, was a vessel of the type often seen in coastwise trade in the far southern Atlantic, their crews composed of the offscourings of the sea--unhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race and every nation.</p> <p>The Fuwalda was no exception to the rule. Her officers were swarthy bullies, hating and hated by their crew. The captain, while a competent seaman, was a brute in his treatment of his men. He knew, or at least he used, but two arguments in his dealings with them--a belaying pin and a revolver--nor is it likely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else.</p> <p>So it was that from the second day out from Freetown John Clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the Fuwalda such as they had believed were never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea.</p> <p>It was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what was destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then unborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man.</p> <p>Two sailors were washing down the decks of the Fuwalda, the first mate was on duty, and the captain had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice.</p> <p>The men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from the sailors. Closer and closer they came, until one of them was directly behind the captain. In another moment he would have passed by and this strange narrative would never have been recorded.</p> <p>But just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and Lady Greystoke, and, as he did so, tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck, overturning the water- pail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents.</p> <p>For an instant the scene was ludicrous; but only for an instant. With a volley of awful oaths, his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage, the captain regained his feet, and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck.</p> <p>The man was small and rather old, so that the brutality of the act was thus accentuated. The other seaman, however, was neither old nor small--a huge bear of a man, with fierce black mustachios, and a great bull neck set between massive shoulders.</p> <p>As he saw his mate go down he crouched, and, with a low snarl, sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow.</p> <p>From scarlet the officer's face went white, for this was mutiny; and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal career. Without waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from his pocket, firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle towering before him; but, quick as he was, John Clayton was almost as quick, so that the bullet which was intended for the sailor's heart lodged in the sailor's leg instead, for Lord Greystoke had struck down the captain's arm as he had seen the weapon flash in the sun.</p> <p>Words passed between Clayton and the captain, the former making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew, nor would he countenance anything further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained passengers.</p> <p>The captain was on the point of making an angry reply, but, thinking better of it, turned on his heel and black and scowling, strode aft.</p> <p>He did not care to antagonize an English official, for the Queen's mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate, and which he feared--England's far-reaching navy.</p> <p>The two sailors picked themselves up, the older man assisting his wounded comrade to rise. The big fellow, who was known among his mates as Black Michael, tried his leg gingerly, and, finding that it bore his weight, turned to Clayton with a word of gruff thanks.</p> <p>Though the fellow's tone was surly, his words were evidently well meant. Ere he had scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation.</p> <p>They did not see him again for several days, nor did the captain accord them more than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them.</p> <p>They took their meals in his cabin, as they had before the unfortunate occurrence; but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted him to eat at the same time.</p> <p>The other officers were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little above the villainous crew they bullied, and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished English noble and his lady, so that the Claytons were left very much to themselves.</p> <p>This in itself accorded perfectly with their desires, but it also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy.</p> </div></section></article></div></main> <aside class="outer read-next"><div class=inner><div class=read-next-feed><article class=read-next-card><header class=read-next-card-header><h3><span>More in</span> <a href=tag/fiction>Fiction</a></h3></header> <div class=read-next-card-content><ul><li><h4><a href=https://demo.ghost.io/the-businessman-the-fisherman/ >The Businessman & The Fisherman</a></h4> <div class=read-next-card-meta><p><time datetime="12 M08 2014">12 M08 2014</time> – 2 min read </div> <li><h4><a href=https://demo.ghost.io/out-to-sea/ >Out to Sea</a></h4> <div class=read-next-card-meta><p><time datetime="24 M07 1912">24 M07 1912</time> – 6 min read </div> <li><h4><a href=https://demo.ghost.io/looking-glass-house/ >Looking-Glass house</a></h4> <div class=read-next-card-meta><p><time datetime="18 M03 1871">18 M03 1871</time> – 10 min read </div> </ul></div> <footer class=read-next-card-footer><a href=tag/fiction>See more posts →</a></footer></article> <article class="post-card the-purpose-of-education"><a href=the-purpose-of-education class=post-card-image-link><img alt="The Purpose of Education" src=https://demo.ghost.io/content/images/2015/04/demo4.jpg class=post-card-image loading=lazy></a> <div class=post-card-content><a href=the-purpose-of-education class=post-card-content-link><header class=post-card-header><div class=post-card-primary-tag>Speeches</div> <h2 class=post-card-title>The Purpose of Education</h2></header> <section class=post-card-excerpt><p>As I engage in the so-called "bull sessions" around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education.
