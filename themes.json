Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.”</p>\n<p>He continued, “Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village, of course, and move to Mexico City, then to Los Angeles, and eventually to New York City, where you could run your expanded enterprise with proper management.</p>\n<p>The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, señor, how long will all this take?”</p>\n<p>To which the American replied, “15-20 years, 25 tops.”</p>\n<p>“But what then, señor?”</p>\n<p>The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part.
