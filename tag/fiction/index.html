The preferment seemed to him in the nature of a well-merited reward for painstaking and intelligent service, and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance and responsibility; but, on the other hand, he had been married to the Hon. Alice Rutherford for scarce a three months, and it was the thought of taking this fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical Africa that appalled him.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor her sake he would have refused the appointment, but she would not have it so.

Her officers were swarthy bullies, hating and hated by their crew. The captain, while a competent seaman, was a brute in his treatment of his men. He knew, or at least he used, but two arguments in his dealings with them--a belaying pin and a revolver--nor is it likely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it was that from the second day out from Freetown John Clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the Fuwalda such as they had believed were never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what was destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then unborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo sailors were washing down the decks of the Fuwalda, the first mate was on duty, and the captain had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from the sailors. Closer and closer they came, until one of them was directly behind the captain. In another moment he would have passed by and this strange narrative would never have been recorded.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and Lady Greystoke, and, as he did so, tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck, overturning the water- pail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor an instant the scene was ludicrous; but only for an instant. With a volley of awful oaths, his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage, the captain regained his feet, and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe man was small and rather old, so that the brutality of the act was thus accentuated. The other seaman, however, was neither old nor small--a huge bear of a man, with fierce black mustachios, and a great bull neck set between massive shoulders.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs he saw his mate go down he crouched, and, with a low snarl, sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom scarlet the officer's face went white, for this was mutiny; and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal career. Without waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from his pocket, firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle towering before him; but, quick as he was, John Clayton was almost as quick, so that the bullet which was intended for the sailor's heart lodged in the sailor's leg instead, for Lord Greystoke had struck down the captain's arm as he had seen the weapon flash in the sun.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWords passed between Clayton and the captain, the former making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew, nor would he countenance anything further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained passengers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe captain was on the point of making an angry reply, but, thinking better of it, turned on his heel and black and scowling, strode aft.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe did not care to antagonize an English official, for the Queen's mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate, and which he feared--England's far-reaching navy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe two sailors picked themselves up, the older man assisting his wounded comrade to rise. The big fellow, who was known among his mates as Black Michael, tried his leg gingerly, and, finding that it bore his weight, turned to Clayton with a word of gruff thanks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThough the fellow's tone was surly, his words were evidently well meant. Ere he had scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey did not see him again for several days, nor did the captain accord them more than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey took their meals in his cabin, as they had before the unfortunate occurrence; but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted him to eat at the same time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other officers were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little above the villainous crew they bullied, and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished English noble and his lady, so that the Claytons were left very much to themselves.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis in itself accorded perfectly with their desires, but it also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C!--kg-card-end: markdown--\u003E",comment_id:"4",feature_image:"https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fcontent\u002Fimages\u002F2015\u002F04\u002Fdemo6.jpg",featured:g,visibility:b,created_at:"2014-09-27T10:54:34.000+00:00",updated_at:F,published_at:"1912-07-24T08:00:00.000+00:00",custom_excerpt:a,codeinjection_head:a,codeinjection_foot:a,custom_template:a,canonical_url:a,send_email_when_published:g,tags:[{id:d,name:e,slug:c,description:a,feature_image:a,visibility:b,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,og_image:a,og_title:a,og_description:a,twitter_image:a,twitter_title:a,twitter_description:a,codeinjection_head:a,codeinjection_foot:a,canonical_url:a,accent_color:a,url:f}],authors:[{id:G,name:H,slug:I,profile_image:J,cover_image:K,bio:L,website:a,location:M,facebook:a,twitter:a,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,url:N}],primary_author:{id:G,name:H,slug:I,profile_image:J,cover_image:K,bio:L,website:a,location:M,facebook:a,twitter:a,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,url:N},primary_tag:{id:d,name:e,slug:c,description:a,feature_image:a,visibility:b,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,og_image:a,og_title:a,og_description:a,twitter_image:a,twitter_title:a,twitter_description:a,codeinjection_head:a,codeinjection_foot:a,canonical_url:a,accent_color:a,url:f},url:"https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fout-to-sea\u002F",excerpt:"I had this story from one who had no business to tell it to me, or to any other.\nI may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the\nbeginning of it, and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed\nfor the balance of the strange tale.\n\nWhen my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much, and that I was\nprone to doubtfulness, his foolish pride assumed the task the old vintage had\ncommenced, and so he unearthed written evidence in the form of m",reading_time:6,access:h,og_image:a,og_title:a,og_description:a,twitter_image:a,twitter_title:a,twitter_description:a,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,email_subject:a},{id:"5979a77cdf093500228e95eb",uuid:"b0f08928-f6a0-4ba7-a971-851ea326ed6c",title:"Looking-Glass house",slug:"looking-glass-house",html:"\u003C!--kg-card-begin: markdown--\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it:— it was the black kitten’s fault entirely.

But she didn’t get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?’ Alice began. ‘You’d have guessed if you’d been up in the window with me — only Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn’t.

Never mind, Kitty, we’ll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.’ Here Alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten’s neck, just to see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,’ Alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again, ‘when I saw all the mischief you had been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow! And you’d have deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What have you got to say for yourself? Now don’t interrupt me!’ she went on, holding up one finger. ‘I’m going to tell you all your faults. Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning. Now you can’t deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What’s that you say?’ (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) ‘Her paw went into your eye? Well, that’s your fault, for keeping your eyes open — if you’d shut them tight up, it wouldn’t have happened. Now don’t make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were thirsty, were you?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you know she wasn’t thirsty too? Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn’t looking!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘That’s three faults, Kitty, and you’ve not been punished for any of them yet. You know I’m saving up all your punishments for Wednesday week — Suppose they had saved up all my punishments!’ she went on, talking more to herself than the kitten. ‘What would they do at the end of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came. Or — let me see — suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn’t mind that much! I’d far rather go without them than eat them!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, “Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.” And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress themselves all in green, and dance about — whenever the wind blows — oh, that’s very pretty!’ cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands. ‘And I do so wish it was true! I’m sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don’t smile, my dear, I’m asking it seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when I said “Check!” you purred! Well, it was a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn’t been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces. Kitty, dear, let’s pretend —’ And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase ‘Let’s pretend.’ She had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before — all because Alice had begun with ‘Let’s pretend we’re kings and queens;’ and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn’t, because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last to say, ‘Well, you can be one of them then, and I’ll be all the rest.’ And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, ‘Nurse! Do let’s pretend that I’m a hungry hyaena, and you’re a bone.’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut this is taking us away from Alice’s speech to the kitten. ‘Let’s pretend that you’re the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you sat up and folded your arms, you’d look exactly like her. Now do try, there’s a dear!’ And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing didn’t succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn’t fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was —‘and if you’re not good directly,’ she added, ‘I’ll put you through into Looking-glass House. How would you like that?’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Now, if you’ll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I’ll tell you all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there’s the room you can see through the glass — that’s just the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a chair — all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could see that bit! I want so much to know whether they’ve a fire in the winter: you never can tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too — but that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because I’ve held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the other room.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if they’d give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn’t good to drink — But oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a little peep of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open: and it’s very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond. Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-glass House! I’m sure it’s got, oh! such beautiful things in it!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s pretend there’s a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty. Let’s pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. Why, it’s turning into a sort of mist now, I declare! It’ll be easy enough to get through —’ She was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly the glass was beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. ‘So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room,’ thought Alice: ‘warmer, in fact, because there’ll be no one here to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun it’ll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and can’t get at me!’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘They don’t keep this room so tidy as the other,’ Alice thought to herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little ‘Oh!’ of surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking about, two and two!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,’ Alice said (in a whisper, for fear of frightening them), ‘and there are the White King and the White Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel — and here are two castles walking arm in arm — I don’t think they can hear me,’ she went on, as she put her head closer down, ‘and I’m nearly sure they can’t see me. I feel somehow as if I were invisible —’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next.\u003Cbr\u003E\n‘It is the voice of my child!’ the White Queen cried out as she rushed past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders. ‘My precious Lily! My imperial kitten!’ and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Imperial fiddlestick!’ said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a little annoyed with the Queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes, ‘Mind the volcano!’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘What volcano?’ said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Blew — me — up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath. ‘Mind you come up — the regular way — don’t get blown up!’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at last she said, ‘Why, you’ll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. I’d far better help you, hadn’t I?’ But the King took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn’t take his breath away: but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘Oh! please don’t make such faces, my dear!’ she cried out, quite forgetting that the King couldn’t hear her. ‘You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you! And don’t keep your mouth so wide open! All the ashes will get into it — there, now I think you’re tidy enough!’ she added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the Queen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisper — so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe King was saying, ‘I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers!’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo which the Queen replied, ‘You haven’t got any whiskers.’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘The horror of that moment,’ the King went on, ‘I shall never, never forget!’\u003Cbr\u003E\n‘You will, though,’ the Queen said, ‘if you don’t make a memorandum of it.’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him, and at last he panted out, ‘My dear! I really must get a thinner pencil. I can’t manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I don’t intend —’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E‘What manner of things?’ said the Queen, looking over the book (in which Alice had put ‘the White Knight is sliding down the poker. He balances very badly’) ‘That’s not a memorandum of your feelings!’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C!--kg-card-end: markdown--\u003E",comment_id:"8",feature_image:"https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fcontent\u002Fimages\u002F2015\u002F04\u002Fdemo5.jpg",featured:g,visibility:b,created_at:"2014-09-27T16:23:18.000+00:00",updated_at:"2019-02-13T15:27:08.000+00:00",published_at:"1871-03-18T10:00:00.000+00:00",custom_excerpt:a,codeinjection_head:a,codeinjection_foot:a,custom_template:a,canonical_url:a,send_email_when_published:g,tags:[{id:d,name:e,slug:c,description:a,feature_image:a,visibility:b,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,og_image:a,og_title:a,og_description:a,twitter_image:a,twitter_title:a,twitter_description:a,codeinjection_head:a,codeinjection_foot:a,canonical_url:a,accent_color:a,url:f}],authors:[{id:i,name:j,slug:k,profile_image:l,cover_image:a,bio:m,website:a,location:n,facebook:a,twitter:a,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,url:o}],primary_author:{id:i,name:j,slug:k,profile_image:l,cover_image:a,bio:m,website:a,location:n,facebook:a,twitter:a,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,url:o},primary_tag:{id:d,name:e,slug:c,description:a,feature_image:a,visibility:b,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,og_image:a,og_title:a,og_description:a,twitter_image:a,twitter_title:a,twitter_description:a,codeinjection_head:a,codeinjection_foot:a,canonical_url:a,accent_color:a,url:f},url:"https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Flooking-glass-house\u002F",excerpt:"One thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it:— it\nwas the black kitten’s fault entirely.

Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! 'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) '—yes, that's about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPresently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—' (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) '—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked &quot;poison&quot; or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this bottle was not marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a telescope.'\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. 'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!'\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C!--kg-card-end: markdown--\u003E",comment_id:"3",feature_image:"https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fcontent\u002Fimages\u002F2015\u002F04\u002Fdemo2.jpg",featured:g,visibility:b,created_at:"2014-09-27T10:52:08.000+00:00",updated_at:F,published_at:"1865-11-26T10:00:00.000+00:00",custom_excerpt:a,codeinjection_head:a,codeinjection_foot:a,custom_template:a,canonical_url:a,send_email_when_published:g,tags:[{id:d,name:e,slug:c,description:a,feature_image:a,visibility:b,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,og_image:a,og_title:a,og_description:a,twitter_image:a,twitter_title:a,twitter_description:a,codeinjection_head:a,codeinjection_foot:a,canonical_url:a,accent_color:a,url:f}],authors:[{id:i,name:j,slug:k,profile_image:l,cover_image:a,bio:m,website:a,location:n,facebook:a,twitter:a,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,url:o}],primary_author:{id:i,name:j,slug:k,profile_image:l,cover_image:a,bio:m,website:a,location:n,facebook:a,twitter:a,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,url:o},primary_tag:{id:d,name:e,slug:c,description:a,feature_image:a,visibility:b,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,og_image:a,og_title:a,og_description:a,twitter_image:a,twitter_title:a,twitter_description:a,codeinjection_head:a,codeinjection_foot:a,canonical_url:a,accent_color:a,url:f},url:"https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fdown-the-rabbit-hole\u002F",excerpt:"Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and\nof having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister\nwas reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use\nof a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day\nmade her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a\ndaisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getti",reading_time:8,access:h,og_image:a,og_title:a,og_description:a,twitter_image:a,twitter_title:a,twitter_description:a,meta_title:a,meta_description:a,email_subject:a}]},settings:{title:"Ghost",description:"The professional publishing platform",logo:"https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fcontent\u002Fimages\u002F2014\u002F09\u002FGhost-Transparent-for-DARK-BG.png",icon:"https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fcontent\u002Fimages\u002F2017\u002F07\u002Ffavicon.png",cover_image:"https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fcontent\u002Fimages\u002F2019\u002F10\u002Fpublication-cover.png",facebook:"ghost",twitter:"@tryghost",lang:"en",timezone:"Etc\u002FUTC",codeinjection_head:a,codeinjection_foot:"\u003Cscript src=\"\u002F\u002Frum-static.pingdom.net\u002Fpa-5d8850cd3a70310008000482.js\" async\u003E\u003C\u002Fscript\u003E",navigation:[{label:"Home",url:"\u002F"},{label:"About",url:"\u002Fabout\u002F"},{label:"Getting Started",url:"\u002Ftag\u002Fgetting-started\u002F"},{label:"Try Ghost",url:"https:\u002F\u002Fghost.org"}],secondary_navigation:[],meta_title:a,meta_description:a,og_image:a,og_title:a,og_description:a,twitter_image:a,twitter_title:a,twitter_description:a,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002F"}}}(null,"public","fiction","5979a779df093500228e9587","Fiction","https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Ftag\u002Ffiction\u002F",false,true,"5979a779df093500228e958e","Lewis Carroll","lewis","https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fcontent\u002Fimages\u002F2014\u002F09\u002Flewis.jpeg","My real name is Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, but people call me Lewis.
