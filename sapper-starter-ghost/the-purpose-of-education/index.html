Most of the \"brethren\" think that education should equip them with\nthe proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the\nmasses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends\nrather than means to an end.\n\nIt seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of\nman and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must\nenable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the\nligitimate goals of his life.\n\nEducation must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To\nthink incisively and to think for one's self is very difficult. We are prone to\nlet our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and\npropaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling\nits purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think\nlogically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and\nthe pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To\nsave man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims\nof education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern\nthe true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the\nfiction.\n\nThe function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and\nto think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the\ngreatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted\nwith reason, but with no morals.\n\nThe late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of\nGeorgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all\nmeasuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he\ncontends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call\neducated?\n\nWe must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus\ncharacter--that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one\nnot only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to\nconcentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the\naccumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social\nliving.\n\nIf we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded,\nunscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts.

The natives of the British Colony complained that many of their young men were enticed away through the medium of fair and glowing promises, but that few if any ever returned to their families.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Englishmen in Africa went even further, saying that these poor blacks were held in virtual slavery, since after their terms of enlistment expired their ignorance was imposed upon by their white officers, and they were told that they had yet several years to serve.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so the Colonial Office appointed John Clayton to a new post in British West Africa, but his confidential instructions centered on a thorough investigation of the unfair treatment of black British subjects by the officers of a friendly European power. Why he was sent, is, however, of little moment to this story, for he never made an investigation, nor, in fact, did he ever reach his destination.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EClayton was the type of Englishman that one likes best to associate with the noblest monuments of historic achievement upon a thousand victorious battlefields--a strong, virile man --mentally, morally, and physically.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn stature he was above the average height; his eyes were gray, his features regular and strong; his carriage that of perfect, robust health influenced by his years of army training.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPolitical ambition had caused him to seek transference from the army to the Colonial Office and so we find him, still young, entrusted with a delicate and important commission in the service of the Queen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen he received this appointment he was both elated and appalled. The preferment seemed to him in the nature of a well-merited reward for painstaking and intelligent service, and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance and responsibility; but, on the other hand, he had been married to the Hon. Alice Rutherford for scarce a three months, and it was the thought of taking this fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical Africa that appalled him.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor her sake he would have refused the appointment, but she would not have it so. Instead she insisted that he accept, and, indeed, take her with him.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere were mothers and brothers and sisters, and aunts and cousins to express various opinions on the subject, but as to what they severally advised history is silent.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe know only that on a bright May morning in 1888, John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice sailed from Dover on their way to Africa.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA month later they arrived at Freetown where they chartered a small sailing vessel, the Fuwalda, which was to bear them to their final destination.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd here John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice, his wife, vanished from the eyes and from the knowledge of men.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port of Freetown a half dozen British war vessels were scouring the south Atlantic for trace of them or their little vessel, and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was found upon the shores of St. Helena which convinced the world that the Fuwalda had gone down with all on board, and hence the search was stopped ere it had scarce begun; though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Fuwalda, a barkentine of about one hundred tons, was a vessel of the type often seen in coastwise trade in the far southern Atlantic, their crews composed of the offscourings of the sea--unhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race and every nation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Fuwalda was no exception to the rule. Her officers were swarthy bullies, hating and hated by their crew. The captain, while a competent seaman, was a brute in his treatment of his men. He knew, or at least he used, but two arguments in his dealings with them--a belaying pin and a revolver--nor is it likely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it was that from the second day out from Freetown John Clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the Fuwalda such as they had believed were never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what was destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then unborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo sailors were washing down the decks of the Fuwalda, the first mate was on duty, and the captain had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from the sailors. Closer and closer they came, until one of them was directly behind the captain. In another moment he would have passed by and this strange narrative would never have been recorded.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and Lady Greystoke, and, as he did so, tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck, overturning the water- pail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor an instant the scene was ludicrous; but only for an instant. With a volley of awful oaths, his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage, the captain regained his feet, and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe man was small and rather old, so that the brutality of the act was thus accentuated. The other seaman, however, was neither old nor small--a huge bear of a man, with fierce black mustachios, and a great bull neck set between massive shoulders.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs he saw his mate go down he crouched, and, with a low snarl, sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom scarlet the officer's face went white, for this was mutiny; and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal career. Without waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from his pocket, firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle towering before him; but, quick as he was, John Clayton was almost as quick, so that the bullet which was intended for the sailor's heart lodged in the sailor's leg instead, for Lord Greystoke had struck down the captain's arm as he had seen the weapon flash in the sun.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWords passed between Clayton and the captain, the former making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew, nor would he countenance anything further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained passengers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe captain was on the point of making an angry reply, but, thinking better of it, turned on his heel and black and scowling, strode aft.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe did not care to antagonize an English official, for the Queen's mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate, and which he feared--England's far-reaching navy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe two sailors picked themselves up, the older man assisting his wounded comrade to rise. The big fellow, who was known among his mates as Black Michael, tried his leg gingerly, and, finding that it bore his weight, turned to Clayton with a word of gruff thanks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThough the fellow's tone was surly, his words were evidently well meant. Ere he had scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey did not see him again for several days, nor did the captain accord them more than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey took their meals in his cabin, as they had before the unfortunate occurrence; but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted him to eat at the same time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other officers were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little above the villainous crew they bullied, and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished English noble and his lady, so that the Claytons were left very much to themselves.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis in itself accorded perfectly with their desires, but it also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C!--kg-card-end:

At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character--that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts. Be careful, &quot;brethren!&quot; Be careful, teachers!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C!--kg-card-end: markdown--\u003E","9","https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fcontent\u002Fimages\u002F2015\u002F04\u002Fdemo4.jpg","2014-09-27T16:33:16.000+00:00","2019-02-14T09:40:25.000+00:00","1948-12-12T10:00:00.000+00:00","https:\u002F\u002Fdemo.ghost.io\u002Fthe-purpose-of-education\u002F","As I engage in the so-called \"bull sessions\" around and about the school, I too\noften find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of\neducation.

This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the &quot;unalienable Rights&quot; of &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot; It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked &quot;insufficient funds.&quot;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe cannot walk alone.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe cannot turn back.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, &quot;When will you be satisfied?&quot; We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: &quot;For Whites Only.&quot; We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until &quot;justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.&quot;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream.

Most of the "brethren" think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.</p> <p>It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.</p> <p>Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one's self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.</p> <p>The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.</p> <p>The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?</p> <p>We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character--that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.</p> <p>If we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts. Be careful, "brethren!" Be careful, teachers!</p> </div></section></article></div></main> <aside class="outer read-next"><div class=inner><div class=read-next-feed><article class=read-next-card><header class=read-next-card-header><h3><span>More in</span> <a href=tag/speeches>Speeches</a></h3></header> <div class=read-next-card-content><ul><li><h4><a href=https://demo.ghost.io/i-have-a-dream/ >I Have a Dream</a></h4> <div class=read-next-card-meta><p><time datetime="28 M08 1963">28 M08 1963</time> – 6 min read </div> <li><h4><a href=https://demo.ghost.io/the-purpose-of-education/ >The Purpose of Education</a></h4> <div class=read-next-card-meta><p><time datetime="12 M12 1948">12 M12 1948</time> – 2 min read </div> </ul></div> <footer class=read-next-card-footer><a href=tag/speeches>See more posts →</a></footer></article> <article class="post-card i-have-a-dream"><a href=i-have-a-dream class=post-card-image-link><img alt="I Have a Dream" src=https://demo.ghost.io/content/images/2015/04/demo3.jpg class=post-card-image loading=lazy></a> <div class=post-card-content><a href=i-have-a-dream class=post-card-content-link><header class=post-card-header><div class=post-card-primary-tag>Speeches</div> <h2 class=post-card-title>I Have a Dream</h2></header> <section class=post-card-excerpt><p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
