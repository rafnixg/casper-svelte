Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog. </li><li>It's possible to work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of <a href=\"https://ghost.org/integrations/\">integrations</a> to speed up your workflows, connect email lists, build communities and much more.</li></ol><h2 id=\"behind-the-scenes\">Behind the scenes</h2><p>Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation.
